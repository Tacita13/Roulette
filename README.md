# Roulette
This is a game called Roulette in which the player bets an amount for one 
or more rounds on either a number(0-36), a color (red or black) or a 
column(left, middle, right).
All the inputs must be given in numbers ie. every answer has its number and 
the game has its own user input control. After the input the game compares the
result of a dice(random number) with the given bet and shows if the player has
won or lost. Additionally the player starts with a back account up to 1000euros
and if he loses the his bet will be substracted, vice versa if he wins added.
